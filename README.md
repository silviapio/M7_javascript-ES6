## Concept
Opening index.html, a button for each of the 7 exercises will appear. Clicking on the corresponding button, a function will be called from main.js and the output will be displayed on the console.
### Exercise 1
Clicking on Output 1, the function literals1() is executed. The function simply shows in console the given variable using ES6 literals and interpolation.
### Exercise 2
Clicking on Output 2, the function arrowFunctions2() is executed. Each of the 5 functions given is modified as arrow function and then run using some parameters. 
### Exercise 3
Clicking on Output 3, the function correctError3() is executed. The syntax error is corrected and the result is an array with first names only.
### Exercise 4
Clicking on Output 4, the function useReduce4() is executed. The given array is turned into a string using reduce().
### Exercise 5
Clicking on Output 5, the function reverseString5('abcdefg') is called. The string is reversed using the spread operator and reverse().
### Exercise 6
Clicking on Output 6, the function a6() is executed. The given script (using a promise) is replicated using a async function and await; the result is the same. For further info please check the original function in main.js comments.
### Exercise 7
